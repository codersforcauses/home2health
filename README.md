# Home2Health

> In 2012, the ABS estimated that there were an estimated 9,595 homeless people - living in a temporary or improvised dwelling, sleeping out, or in tents - in Western Australia, with the national figure at 116, 000 (ABS 2016).  
>
> This project is concerned with aiding two researchers, Shannen Vallesi - a Research Officer with the School of Population and Health at UWA - Associate Professor and Senior Research Fellow, Lisa Wood -  and their colleagues in creating a multi-purpose website to not only host their research, but to create a forum for discussion, and collaboration, for professionals and individuals, to tackle the growing issues surrounding homelessness and health in Australia, and beyond. There are over 80 different individuals and organisations who are interested in the outcome of this project.
