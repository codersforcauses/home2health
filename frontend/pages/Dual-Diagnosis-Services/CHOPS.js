            The 20 Lives 20 Homes project will be the first place-based trial of
            the 50 Homes 50 Lives housing first model in the metropolitan area,
            based in Fremantle. The St Patrickâ€™s 20 Lives 20 Homes team will
            work along with Ruah and a range of collaborating agencies, to
            provide intensive wrap around support to individuals facing complex
            barriers to exiting homelessness. This project is due to commence in
            2019.
