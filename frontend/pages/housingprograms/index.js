        <p>
          The 50 Lives 50 Homes project is the first Housing First program in
          Western Australia, and one of the first in Australia. 50 Lives is a
          collective impact initiative aiming to provide long-term housing and
          support to the most vulnerable individuals and families rough sleeping
          in Perth. The collaborative includes 28 different organisations in
          Perth (with backbone support from
          <em>
            <a href="https://www.ruah.org.au/" style={{ color: '#0f6489' }}>
              {' '}
              Ruah Community Services
            </a>
          </em>
          ) , including homelessness services, housing agencies, health
          providers, and mental health and community services.
          <br />
          <br />
          To date, over 200 people have been housed through the 50 Lives
          project. The Home2Health Team have been involved in the evaluation of
          50 Lives since 2016. The evaluation draws on a mix of data including
          the VI-SPDAT, administrative hospital and police data and interviews
          with 50 Lives clients and organisations involved in the project.
