      <p>
        The Cottage is a supportive, home like environment where Complex Care
        Services and Hospital in the Home (HITH) services are provided to people
        who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.
      </p>

        The Cottage focuses on building rapport and trust between clients and
        staff, enabling staff to establish a safe environment and platform from
        which they can address clientsâ€™ health issues.
